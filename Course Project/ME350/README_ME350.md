# MECHENG 350 – Design and Manufacturing II

This folder contains selected work from **MECHENG 350: Design and Manufacturing II** at the University of Michigan.

MECHENG 350 is a 4-credit course on the principles of mechanical design and manufacturing. Topics include:
- Analysis, synthesis, and selection of mechanisms and machine components,
- Introduction to mechatronic components and associated manufacturing processes,
- A semester-long, model-based design–build–test project completed in a team setting.

The materials here highlight Wenyue Li’s contributions to:
- Concept generation and mechanism selection based on functional and manufacturing constraints,
- Detailed CAD modeling, tolerance and manufacturing planning,
- Prototyping, testing, and iterating on a mechatronic system as part of a team project.

These artifacts are intended to demonstrate Wenyue Li’s ability to integrate design theory with practical manufacturing and team-based project execution.
