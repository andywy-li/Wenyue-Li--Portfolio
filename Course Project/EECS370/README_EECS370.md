# EECS 370 – Introduction to Computer Organization

This folder contains selected work from **EECS 370: Introduction to Computer Organization** at the University of Michigan.

EECS 370 is a 4-credit course on the basic concepts of computer organization and hardware. Topics include:
- The stored-program concept and instruction set architecture,
- How a processor executes instructions written in a simple assembly language,
- Data path and control for multiple implementations of a processor,
- Performance evaluation and pipelining,
- Caches, virtual memory, and basic input/output.

The materials here highlight Wenyue Li’s work on:
- Implementing and testing assembly programs for a simplified LC-2K–style machine,
- Designing and modifying components of the processor data path and control logic,
- Analyzing performance impacts of pipelining and memory hierarchy.

These projects are intended to demonstrate Wenyue Li’s understanding of low-level computer organization and the hardware–software interface.
