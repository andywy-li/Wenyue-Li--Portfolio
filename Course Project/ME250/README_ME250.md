# MECHENG 250 – Design and Manufacturing I

This folder contains selected work from **MECHENG 250: Design and Manufacturing I** at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

MECHENG 250 is a 4-credit course that introduces the basics of mechanical design and manufacturing. The course covers:
- Visual thinking, engineering drawing, and machine anatomy,
- Fundamentals of manufacturing processes, materials, and thermofluid considerations,
- Use of CAD systems in different phases of design,
- Basic machine shop techniques and prototyping skills.

The projects included here showcase Wenyue Li’s work on:
- Translating design requirements into manufacturable mechanical components,
- Building 3D CAD models and engineering drawings,
- Planning and executing a design/manufacturing project that integrates analysis, CAD, and shop fabrication.

These materials are intended to demonstrate Wenyue Li’s early experience with hands-on mechanical design and manufacturing practice.
