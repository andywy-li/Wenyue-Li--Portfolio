## 1. Design and Control of Variable-Friction Stick–Slip Positioners – University of Texas at Austin

This project focuses on a **piezoelectric stick–slip nano-positioner** with variable friction to enhance AFM platform load capacity.

Wenyue Li developed the mechanical structure in SOLIDWORKS, validated stiffness and stress using ANSYS FEA, and modeled friction and system dynamics in MATLAB/Simulink to enable open-loop control. Real-time experiments were implemented in LabVIEW with attention to manufacturability and integration with AFM systems.

- **Planned submission:** the AFM-related paper is being prepared for **next year’s IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)**.  
- Because the work is being organized for conference submission, detailed CAD models, codes, and the full manuscript are **not publicly released** here. Only brief summaries may appear.

## 2. Self-Manageable System Architecture Design – University of Calgary

This line of work proposes a **self-manageable system architecture** that combines IEC 61499 function blocks, a multi-agent system, and ARIMA-based prediction for dynamic routing in cyber-physical systems.

Wenyue Li designed and implemented a NetLogo simulation platform, integrated Python scripts to apply ARIMA models for self-optimization under changing workloads, and evaluated performance across multiple scenarios to verify self-adaptation and self-optimization.

- **Current status:** a first-authored paper based on this work has been submitted to the **International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing (IJCIM)** and is currently in the **first revision round**.  
- To respect the double-blind review process, the full manuscript, detailed models, and complete code base **cannot be made public** in this repository.

## 3. Review of AI Applications in Aerospace – Carnegie Mellon University Remote Seminar

In this independent research project, Wenyue Li conducted a structured **literature review on AI applications in aerospace engineering**.

He analyzed and summarized over 50 peer-reviewed publications on topics such as AI-based flight control, fault detection, and navigation, and organized existing work into a coherent survey. This project led to a peer-reviewed publication:

> Li, W. (2024). *The application of artificial intelligence in aerospace engineering.* Applied Computational Engineering, 35, 17–25.

Where permitted, citation information and non-copyrighted figures from the review are referenced here; the full publisher version is not redistributed in this repository.

Overall, this folder is intended to provide a high-level view of Wenyue Li’s research experience.  
For further details or copies of the papers after the peer-review process is complete, please contact Wenyue Li directly.
