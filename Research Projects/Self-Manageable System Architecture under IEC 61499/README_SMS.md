# Self-Manageable Multi-Agent System under IEC 61499

This folder documents Wenyue Li’s research on a **self-manageable multi-agent system architecture** based on IEC 61499 function blocks and data-driven prediction.  
The project was conducted remotely under the supervision of **Prof. Guolin Lyu at the University of Calgary**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this work is to design and evaluate a distributed automation architecture that can **self-optimize** under changing workloads by combining:

- **IEC 61499 function blocks** as the execution and control layer,
- **Multi-agent system (MAS)** concepts for coordination and decision-making,
- **ARIMA-based prediction** for anticipatory scheduling, routing, and load balancing.

Wenyue Li:

- Developed a **Python–NetLogo co-simulation platform** that couples IEC 61499-like function blocks with autonomous agents.
- Integrated **ARIMA time-series prediction** into the agent decision logic to support adaptive routing and dynamic load balancing under varying demand.
- Designed scenarios and experiments to evaluate **self-optimization**, including response to demand spikes, resource failures, and routing changes.
- Analyzed how coordination between function blocks and agents improves adaptability, scalability, and robustness of the distributed automation architecture.

This project demonstrates Wenyue Li’s ability to link control/automation standards (IEC 61499), multi-agent modeling, and machine learning–based prediction into a coherent cyber-physical system framework.
