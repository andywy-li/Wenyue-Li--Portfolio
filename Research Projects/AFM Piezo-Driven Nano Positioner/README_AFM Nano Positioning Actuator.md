# Piezo-Driven Nano-Positioning Actuator for Low-Temperature AFM

This folder documents Wenyue Li’s research on a **piezo-driven nano-positioning actuator** designed to improve load capacity and reduce heat generation for low-temperature atomic force microscopy (AFM).  
The project was conducted under the supervision of **Prof. Fangzhou Xia at the University of Texas at Austin**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this work is to design, model, and experimentally validate a stick–slip nano-positioner with **enhanced load capacity** and **improved thermal efficiency**, making it more suitable for low-temperature AFM environments.

Wenyue Li:

- Designed the actuator in **SolidWorks**, including a flexure-based amplification structure to increase stroke while maintaining sufficient stiffness.
- Performed **ANSYS FEA** to validate stress, stiffness, and displacement, and to refine the amplification geometry.
- Built a **LabVIEW–FPGA–interferometer** experimental platform to deliver high-frequency drive signals, measure nanometer-scale motion, and log stick–slip behavior.
- Developed **MATLAB/Simulink** models for system dynamics and control optimization, focusing on stabilizing stick–slip motion under varying loads.
- Conducted iterative experiments and parameter tuning to reduce reverse slip, improve motion stability, and decrease heat generation under loaded conditions.

This project demonstrates Wenyue Li’s ability to integrate mechanical design, finite-element analysis, control-oriented modeling, and hardware experiments on a precision mechatronic system.

## Publication Status and Data Availability

A full paper based on this work is being prepared for submission to **next year’s IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)**.

Because the manuscript is still under preparation and parts of the design are intended for formal publication, this folder only contains high-level descriptions and selected non-confidential artifacts.  
Detailed CAD models, full experimental datasets, and complete source code are **not publicly released** in this repository at this time.
